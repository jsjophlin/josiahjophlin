## Who am I?

My name is Josiah Jophlin. I grew up in the southern United States (South Carolina specifically), but have moved back and forth from upstate NY, NYC, and SC several times over the years. I currently work for a terrific company called Humio. It provides me with the opportunity to constantly review, test, and implement new tech for Marketing stacks (my bread & butter).

When I'm not working on interesting work or side projects I tend to either be playing a PC game, listening to a podcast or audiobook, or teasing my dogs & cat. Could be all of the above at the same time...

I've been working in the realm of web development for about 15 years now. I started in IT support, taught myself to design & code, and did some side jobs. I've been hooked ever since. I now run the dev team for our Marketing department and handle all web projects and marketing stack integrations (things like Calendly, Hubspot, Marketo, GTM, GDPR, etc.).
